I'm a computational plant biologist with a background in biochemistry, pursuing my PhD at Michigan State University (MSU) in the [ShiuLab](https://shiulab.github.io/), where I apply machine learning and natural language processing techniques to answer biological questions. For more details on active projects, feel free to browse my repositories or view [my website](https://serenalotreck.github.io/projects/).
<br>
<br>
I love science communication, and have written a [guest blog](https://www.msuscicomm.org/post/knowledge-graphs) for MSU SciComm, as well as giving talks on [applications of machine learning in plant biology](https://mediaspace.msu.edu/media/Intro+to+ML+-+GLBRC+Annual+Science+Meeting/1_w6nw7tt8) and [my own research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UHH462mvk&t=2985s). 
<br>
<br>
I'm also a founding member and current president of [QT-Grad](https://cogs.msu.edu/2021/03/attention-graduate-students-new-gso-qt-grad/), an organization for queer and trans graduate students at MSU, and helped found & run the peer mentorship program in my [home depratment](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiQ7q71m_LyAhUhneAKHeQhB0cQFnoECA0QAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fplantbiology.natsci.msu.edu%2F&usg=AOvVaw2FcsY1UX2rMQ5O212-wHJ6).

Fun fact: In my undergrad, I was a rock climbing instructor at the [Lindseth Climbing Center](https://scl.cornell.edu/coe/lindseth-climbing-center)!
